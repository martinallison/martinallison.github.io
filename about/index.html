            <p>A brief summary:</p>
        
            <p>Enjoy nice arrangements of colours and shapes, learning languages, and coding for stuff that’s worthwhile. Danish people, cue sports (yeah!) and unfortunately liquids mixed with alcohol are high on the list too.</p>
        
            <p>Don’t enjoy possessions, undeserved hype, self-promotion and <em>having</em> to be “passionate” about or defined by something as arbitrary as what to do for a living.</p>
        
            <p>Up for doing more creative stuff (this website counts as an attempt at that), something to do with languages, culture or art in general, with small groups of good people, or something totally different all together. As a backup, winning the US Open 9-ball championship would be cool.</p>
        
            <p>Currently taking a break from work and having a nice time somewhere between Lima and Buenos Aires.</p>
