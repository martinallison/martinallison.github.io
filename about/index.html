            <p>Enjoy chaotic arrangements of colours and shapes, learning languages, and coding for stuff that’s worthwhile or fun. Danish people, cue sports (yeah!) and, unfortunately, liquids with varying degrees of alcohol are also high on the list.</p>
        
            <p>Don’t really enjoy possessions, outrage society, undeserved hype, and having to be "passionate" about things like web development frameworks.</p>
        
            <p>Up for doing more creative stuff, something to do with languages, culture, or art in general, with a small group of good people, or something totally different. As a backup I'd be happy with winning the US Open 9-ball championship or something!</p>
        
            <p>Currently taking a break from work and having a nice time somewhere between La Paz and Buenos Aires, but still looking out for cool stuff.</p>
        
            <p>If for some reason you want to know more, <a href="/#contact">talk to me</a> if you like.</p>
